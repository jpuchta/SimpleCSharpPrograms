Here we show that this class of solutions hides a rich variety of bodies and spacetimes. Indeed, one finds undercharged, extremal charged and overcharged stars, regular black holes, and quasiblack holes, these latter may even be considered the real frozen stars [3], i.e., collapsed compact stars with their boundary surfaces looming at their own gravitational radii. The spectrum of solutions also contain bridge spacetimes with negative electromagnetic field energy of the type considered by Einstein and Rosen to mimic an electron as a nonsingular particle solution of the theory [4]. The charged solutions yield appropriately the Andreasson limit [5] which in turn gives the Buchdahl limit in the uncharged case. \n[1] S. Guilfoyle, Gen. Relativ.

The new classes of solutions may posses, or not, Killing symmetries and can be  characterized by  effective induced masses, anisotropic polarized interactions and cosmological constants. For nonholonomic deformations with (conformal) ellipsoid/ toroid and/or solitonic symmetries and, in particular, for small eccentricity rotoid configurations, we can generate wormholes like objects matching external black ellipsoid - de Sitter geometries. We conclude that  the solutions with nontrivial nonholonomically induced torsion can not be alternatively described as effective/analogous Einstein spaces. For zero torsion configurations, there are nonholonomic tansforms and/or non-trivial limits to exact solutions in general relativity when modified/ massive gravity effects are modelled by off-diagonal and/or nonholonomic parametric interactions.};

{ 0264};{ Spinning test particle trajectories in de sitter spacetime};{ Cole R, Gair J, Babak S};{Cole R};{ It is well-known that unstructured test particles in General Relativity follow geodesic trajectories in the background spacetime. This is the leading order result from a multipolar expansion of the energy-momentum tensor of the test body. At next order, including pole and dipole terms, the Mathisson-Papapetrou (MP) equations of motion for spinning test particles are recovered. In addition, a Spin Supplementary Condition (SSC) must be specified to fix the worldline of the body. We present an analytic solution to the MP equations in de Sitter spacetime using the Frenkel-Pirani SSC and the w-condition. We discuss methods of studying the motion of spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes, using the de Sitter solution to gain insight into the problem. This has applications in the generation of waveform templates for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, which consist of a stellar mass compact object in orbit around a supermassive companion. The gravitational waves emitted by such a system are expected to be below the level of noise in a detector and so to extract the waveform from the data using matched filtering, a bank of templates covering the parameter space needs to be produced. The presence of spin in the compact object can lead to a significant dephasing over the lifetime of the inspiral and so it is important to include its effect in waveform templates.};
{ 0302};{ Analyzing and visualizing the kerr vacuum via gradient flows};{ Abdelqader M, Lake K};{Abdelqader M};{ We explore the global structure of the Kerr spacetime using a new visualization and analysis tool based on gradient fields of scalar invariants. We discover that the observable structure (i.e. outside the horizon) of the Kerr vacuum does not vary smoothly with the spin parameter, but goes through a significant qualitative change at some specific "transitional" values of the spin parameter. The number of the gradient fields' critical points and their index, or winding number, along the axis of symmetry changes at these transitional values of angular momentum. This result is more than a mathematical exercise, since these gradient fields represent the cumulative tidal and frame-dragging effects of the spacetime in an observer independent way. Therefore, the result has significant applications in theoretical astrophysics by possibly providing an alternative method to extract mass and angular momentum information in numerical relativity simulations, as well as shedding light on the effect of different spin parameter values on the characteristics of relativist jets produced by black holes.};
{ 0313};{ Magnetized axially symmetric thin dust disks in conformastatic spacetimes};{ Gonzalez G};{Gonzalez G};{ An infinite family of new solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for axially symmetric conformastatic spacetimes is presented. This family of solutions describe thin dust disks made of material sources with a surface conduction current. The solutions are obtained by expressing the metric function and the magnetic potential in terms of an auxiliary function which satisfies the Laplace equation, a characteristic property of the conformastatic spacetimes. By introducing then a finite discontinuity on the first derivatives of the metric tensor, solutions with a delta function type singularity with support on the hypersurface z = 0 are obtained, describing so infinitesimally thin disks of infinite extension. Then, the surface energy-momentum and the surface current density of the disk are obtained by using the formalism of tensorial distributions and their physical content is analyzed. A simple  particular model is presented in which the energy is well behaved everywhere and the energy-momentum tensor satisfies all the energy conditions. Furthermore, although the thin disks are of infinite extension, their total mass is finite.};

These constructions are fairly natural as they arise from stability analyses under infinitesimal separations of non-interacting shell constituents. In this way, their existence compromises the uniqueness of the evolution of thin shell models. We then analyze some conceptual issues associated with the initial value problem for distributional solutions of hyperbolic PDE systems, particularize to the case of thin shells in GR, and propose a mathematical framework in which the IVP might be defined and analyzed. };
{ 0319};{ New spherically symmetric solutions for spherical objects with charge and anisotropic pressures};{ Raghoonundun A, Hobill D};{Raghoonundun A};{ A large number of solutions to the static and spherically symmetric Einstein Field Equations (EFE) in the presence of matter exist.  However numerous reviews show that even under the simplifying assumptions of matter isotropy and charge neutrality, less than 10% of these solutions have properties that are physically realistic.  We have searched for new solutions that forgo the above two simplifications, but at the same time behave physically.  These new solutions are based on the method Tolman used to find the physically realistic Tolman VII (T7) solution.  The T7 method was crucial because of the form of the final differential equation resulting from the T7 density ansatz.  The two new exact solutions found (one incorporating anisotropy, the other both charge and anisotropy) obey well-known conditions for physical acceptability for some parameter ranges.  Since we are solving the EFE directly, an equation of state (EOS) relating energy density and fluid pressure is obtained as a by-product of these solutions.\n};

{ 0425};{ Algebraic classification of kundt geometries in four and higher dimensions};{ Podolsky J, Svarc R};{Podolsky J};{ We present a complete classification of general Kundt class of spacetimes in arbitrary dimension for which the non-expanding, non-twisting, shear-free null direction is a (multiple) WAND. No field equations are used, so that the results apply not only to Einstein's gravity and its extension to higher dimensions, but also to any metric theory of gravity which admits the Kundt spacetimes. By an explicit evaluation of the Weyl tensor in a natural null frame we demonstrate that all Kundt geometries are of type I, and we derive simple necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optically privileged direction becomes double, triple or quadruple WAND. All possible algebraically special types, including the refinement to subtypes, are identified, namely II(a), II(b), II(c), II(d), III(a), III(b), N, O, II_i, III_i, D(a), D(b), D(c) and D(d). The conditions are surprisingly clear and expressed in an invariant form. Some of them are always satisfied in four dimensions. To illustrate our classification scheme, we apply it to several important subfamilies of the Kundt class, namely the pp-waves, the VSI spacetimes, and generalization of the Bertotti-Robinson, Nariai, and Plebanski-Hacyan direct-product spacetimes of any dimension.

{ 0536};{ Deformations of black holes in external gravitational fields};{ G�rlebeck N};{G�rlebeck N};{ The deformation of neutron stars and black holes due to external gravitational fields is characterized by the first and second Love numbers in Newtonian gravity. They measure the deformation of the surface and the induced multipole moment caused by a specific external field. Analogous definitions were employed in General Relativity, e.g., in [T. Damour & O. M. Lecian, PRD, 80,044017 (2009); T. Binnington & E. Poisson, PRD, 80, 084018 (2009)]. However, these approaches require necessarily linearization and approximations. With these approximations, it was established that the second Love numbers of static black holes vanish. Is this still true if higher non-linear effects are taken into account? \n\nIn this talk, I employ the source integrals for asymptotic multipole moments of [N. G�rlebeck, gr-qc/arXiv:1207.4500] to show analytically without any perturbation scheme that the induced multipole moments and, thus, the second Love numbers of static black holes vanish. Thereby, I corroborate the existing results without resorting to any approximations. This implies that the contributions of the distorted black hole to the asymptotic multipole moments are exactly those of an undistorted Schwarzschild black hole. This can be seen as a generalization of the no-hair theorem if additional matter is present. Nonetheless, the internal geometry of the horizon changes, which is characterized by the first Love numbers.};

Since that time, the subject has developed to a very high degree of sophistication both theoretically and observationally. Nevertheless, much of the work on the subject has focused on lensing in stationary systems. In this talk, I discuss lensing by (decidedly non-stationary) gravitational waves. Assuming planar symmetry, various results can be computed exactly. Images of objects are typically distorted, change brightness and color, and appear to move across an observer's sky due to the presence of gravitational waves. Multiple images can also be formed. Even in the simplest cases involving short wavepackets, extremely dramatic effects occur generically. Essentially any observer in such a spacetime eventually reaches a point in time at which light from the entire universe is momentarily concentrated to a single point in the sky. Formally, this light is infinitely blueshifted and was emitted in the infinitely distant past. Later, the contributions to this flash from different sources appear to separate from each other, dim, and then redshift away. };
