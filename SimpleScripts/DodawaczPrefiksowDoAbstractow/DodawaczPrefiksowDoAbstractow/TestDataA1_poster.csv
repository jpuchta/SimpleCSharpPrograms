The disks are obtained from solutions of the Einstein equations for an axially symmetric conformastatic spacetime in which the metric tensor is characterized only by one metric function. By introducing a finite discontinuity on the first derivatives of the metric tensor, solutions with a singularity of the delta function type are obtained, so that they describe infinite thin disks. The nonzero components of the energy-momentum tensor, both for the disk and the halo, are obtained from the Einstein equations. In this way, the energy densities and pressures of the sources are determined. By imposing the fulfillment of all the energy conditions we obtain a constraint over the solutions, in such a way that the metric function can be properly expressed in terms of a solution of the Laplace equation.  A simple particular example is presented with energy densities and pressures well behaved everywhere. Furthermore, although the disks and the haloes are of infinite extension, their masses are finites.};
{ 0279};{ Relativistic static thin disks with electrically and magnetically polarized material source};{ Gonzalez G, Navarro A};{Navarro A};{ An infinite family of relativistic static thin disks with electrically and magnetically polarized material source is presented. The solutions are obtained by considering the Einstein-Maxwell equations for continuum media in a conformastatic spacetime so that the metric function and the electromagnetic potential can be properly expressed in terms of an auxiliary function solution of the Laplace equation. Then, given a complete solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, a finite discontinuity of the first derivatives of the metric tensor is introduced in order to have a solution with a singularity of the delta function type which can be interpreted as an infinite thin disk. Using then the formalism of tensorial distributions, the energy-momentum tensor of the source is obtained and its physical content is analyzed by determining the behavior of the surface energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses, as well as the components of the electromagnetic field and the surface polarization and magnetization. Finally, a simple example is considered where the all physical quantities are everywhere well behaved, and the energy-momentum tensor of the source is in fully agreement with the complete energy conditions.};

{ 0462};{ Exact interior solutions in einstein-gauss-bonnet gravity};{ Chilambwe B, Hansraj S, Maharaj S};{Chilambwe B};{ While the general theory of relativity proposed by Einstein continues to be the most successful theory of the gravitational field, it does come short in explaining certain observed phenomena such as the late time expansion of the universe. One approach to correct this deficiency is to allow the action principle to include more than just linear forms of the Riemann and Ricci tensor as well as the Ricci scalar. In this regard the Lovelock (1971) polynomial and its simpler version the Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian is useful. We seek to find new exact interior models for 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory in the case of a spherical distribution of perfect fluid. When the higher order effects are switched off, regular Einstein field equations are regained. To our knowledge such exact solutions have not been found, the case of dust (zero pressure) (Ghosh and Maharaj 2012), constant density sphere (Dadhich, et al 2010) and collapse in 5D EGB theory has been studied . It should be noted that the exterior of a 5D sphere in EGB theory is given by the Boulware and Deser metric (1985). We express the 5D EGB field equations in the standard canonical coordinates and then introduce a coordinate transformation which allows the single master field equation to be expressible as a second order ordinary differential equation in one of the gravitational potentials. We then make a choice for the remaining gravitational potential that allows the master field equation to be integrated and analysed. };

This is important not only in the theoretical sense, but in a practical possibility. We consider the problem of the existence of plane waves of torsion in the Poincar� gauge theory of gravity in the space of the Riemann-Cartan with curvature and torsion, and study of the roles of the irreducible parts of torsion.\n     Plane wave metric is a special case of the pp-waves metric , where one of coordinates  makes sense to the retarded time and is interpreted as the phase of the wave. It is known, that a Riemannian space admits a plane wave symmetry group G5, generated by the vector field.\n     Quadratic Lagrangian Poincare gauge theory of gravity, containing the sum of the linear term proportional to the scalar curvature, and the squares of the irreducible parts of the 2-forms of curvature and torsion in space U4. The field equations are obtained by the variation in the  basis of the coordinate 1-forms and the 1-form of the connection. The consequence of these field equations are the conditions on the coupling constants of the original Lagrangian, which means that (a) the waves of metric are flat, and (b) flat torsion waves in space U4 are massless.\n     The presence in the wave solutions of arbitrary functions enables encode the signal and therefore transfer information at the speed of light.};

This metric first emerged in the original theory of gravitation of Yilmaz, in which it was postulated that the metric of a Riemann space is a special function of the scalar field. The interest in this metric aroused by the fact that this metric has no singularity, which is characteristic for the Schwarzschild metric, and does not describe a black hole type solution, but at large distances coincides with the Schwarzschild metric. Therefore existence of the Deser-Dirac scalar field, which is essential, because it has a fundamental, as well as the metric, geometrical status. Under certain circumstances it can modify the black hole metric at short distances. Also there is a possible essential role of the Deser-Dirac field on extremely short distances, which can be manifested, for example, in the fate of the final stage of the collapse of massive stars.};
